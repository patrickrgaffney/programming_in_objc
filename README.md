# Solutions to Programming in Objective-C 6e

These are my solutions to the exercises in the 6th edition of *Programming in Objective-C* by Stephen G. Kochan.

Each chapter corresponds to a folder, inside that folder is a `README.md` and a platoon of objective-c files. The markdown file contains all of the exercise questions, answers to those questions that asked for a little prose, and the filenames of the C files containing the rest of the answers.
